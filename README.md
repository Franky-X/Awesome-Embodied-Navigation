## Call for Cooperators: Join Us in Advancing Embodied Navigation Research
We are excited to invite researchers and experts in the field of embodied navigation to collaborate on an innovative paper aimed at pushing the boundaries of autonomous navigation systems. Our goal is to explore the intersection of interactive perception, neuromorphic cognition, and evolutionary motion capabilities in the development of cutting-edge embodied navigation systems.(Contact: sjtu4742986@sjtu.edu.cn)

## 1. Embodied Navigation Paradigm and Elements

### 1.1 Definition
The **Embodied Navigation System** is a fully autonomous navigation system with **Interactive Perception**, **Neuromorphic Cognition**, and **Motion Execution** capabilities.

### 1.2 Embodied Navigation Paradigm
Given an intelligent agent with a certain degree of freedom, which follows specific motion rules and has hardware parameters, equipped with sensors capable of acquiring extensive environmental observations, we aim to establish a differentiable objective function. This function is designed for joint optimization of the state space and motion space, providing outputs for environment state, motion execution, and agent state.

The primary characteristic of this paradigm lies in the **joint optimization and solving of the agent's state, environmental state, and agent motion**. In contrast to prior navigation methods that may have focused solely on optimizing the agent's state, or SLAM problems which crucially consider the agent and environment, embodied navigation **additionally optimizes its own motion execution**.
