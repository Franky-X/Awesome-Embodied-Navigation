## 1. Embodied Navigation Paradigm and Elements

Embodied navigation (EN) is a novel problem of conducting advanced egocentric navigation tasks through state estimation, task cognition and motion execution for an autonomous robot. Compared with traditional navigation, EN is stressed with the key features of **1) egocentric sensing, 2) interactive engagement with the environment through high degrees of freedom in actions and 3) high-level cognition for complex tasks.**

Recently, an increasing number of works are proposed to solve the problems within the EN system. However, existing studies tend to focus on specific sub-issues, lacking a coherent and unified framework. Consequently, the systematic level and real-world application of EN now remain constrained due to the absence of a comprehensive problem formulation. **To this end, we propose a unified formulation for EN, structured into five stages: transition, observation, fusion, task reward construction and action skills optimization (TOFRA).**


|Embodied Navigation|Traditional Navigation|
|-------------------|----------------------|
|Ego-centric|Global Axis|
|Multi Nodes, n-DoF|Single Node, <=6DoF|
|Evolved Motion Skills|Fixed Movement|
|Autonomous Task Decomposition and Multi-Task Joint Optimization|Manual Task Decomposition for Individual Optimization|
|First Principles|Engineering-Oriented Approach|
|Weak Metricity|Precise Metricity|
|Active Interaction Between Agent and Environment|Passive Perception|

## Call for Cooperators: Join Us in Advancing Embodied Navigation Research
We are excited to invite researchers and experts in the field of embodied navigation to collaborate on an innovative paper aimed at pushing the boundaries of autonomous navigation systems. Our goal is to explore the intersection of interactive perception, neuromorphic cognition, and evolutionary motion capabilities in the development of cutting-edge embodied navigation systems.(Contact: sjtu4742986@sjtu.edu.cn)
